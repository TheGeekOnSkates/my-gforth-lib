\ These are prefixed with "sys-" because they don't do
\ the same as their ANSI escape code counterparts.  Like
\ "reset" doesn't just reset terminal attributes; it also
\ clears the screen.  Similarly, the ANSI "clear" doesn't
\ actually clear the screen - you can scroll up to see what was "cleared".

\ This uses Voxin, a really cool text-to-speech program providing the classic "Eloquence" voice on Linux.
\ I'm still learning the conventional way of documenting stack effects, so I hope str* and strlen make sense (think C).
\ Basically what you want to do is s" text to be spoken" say
: say  ( str* strlen -- )   s\" voxin-say \"" pad place pad +place s\" \" | aplay -q" pad +place pad count system ;

\ This uses Sox, a great Linux command-line tool for playing sounds.
\ Again, not sure if I got the funky shorthand for stack effect down, so here's an example:
\ s" my-sound.ogg" play
: play  ( str* strlen --)   s\" play -q \"" pad place pad +place s\" \" 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null &" pad +place pad count system ;
: play-sync  ( str* strlen --)   s\" play -q \"" pad place pad +place s\" \" 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null" pad +place pad count system ;

: pic  ( str* strlen -- )   s\" ascii-image-converter \"" pad place pad +place s\" \" -C" pad +place pad count system ;

\ Useful for commands like sleep, usleep, ANSI escape codes etc. - anything that requires typing string versions of whole numbers greater than zero (i.e. 12345).

\ NOTE: There was a bug; when depth = 0, it was freezing.
\ idk why "0 0 do ... loop" would cause a freeze (you'd think it would
\ just return immediately) but it must somehow be an infinite loop.
\ Anyway, now having the dup and the if-statement fixes that.
